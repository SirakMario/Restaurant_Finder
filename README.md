## About the App

Resturante locator is a website created to help Geospatial Technology students locate a suitable restaurant near the campus. It allows users to filter by certain preferences and also allows users to comment on their experience in a restaurant they visited. Users also have an additional feature where they can use the website to get directions to a chosen restaurant. Restaurants close to Nova Information Management School (NOVA IMS) Lisbon, University of MÃ¼nster, Institute for Geoinformatics (ifgi), and Universitat Jaume I (UJI) were considered for the app since these are the partner universities for the Geospatial Technologies program.

### Functionality of the Website

The entire process of the website can be divided into three main components, namely:
1. Extract, Transform, and Load.
2. Utilizing APIs with the Django framework to make and receive API calls.
3. Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
4. Docker

#### 1. Extract, Transform, and Load

Google Places API was used to retrieve restaurants within a distance of 1000 meters from both NOVA IMS and ifgi schools. The API call returned a JSON with restaurants that met these requirements, alongside various information about them. The relevant information was extracted from the JSON results and stored in an Excel file (Transform). Django was then utilized to retrieve information from the Excel sheet and transfer it into the PostgreSQL database (Load).

#### 2. Utilizing APIs with the Django framework to make and receive API calls

To prevent users from getting direct access to the database, APIs were used as an intermediary between the user and the database. The Django framework was utilized in achieving this. API calls were made when the user navigated from one page to another, as well as when they made, edited, and deleted comments. This improved the security of the database and prevented the database from being infiltrated.

#### 3. Create Read Update and Delete

A comment section was created under each restaurant. Users can CREATE comments, READ other users' comments, UPDATE their comments by making edits to them, as well as DELETE their comments.

#### 4. Docker

The various parts of the website were put in a Docker container, and then the service was run on a remote server to make the website accessible through an IP address.

### Additional Functions

Open Streets Map and Leaflet Js were used to create a map where users could navigate from their current location to a selected restaurant. The user has the option of getting directions to a selected restaurant. A route is established on the map and dynamically adjusts as the user progresses. The routing feature provides guidance to the user throughout the journey until reaching the final destination.

## The Website

![website pciture](https://github.com/geotech-programming-project/restaurante-finder-final/blob/main/website.png)

The website is made up of different pages. The pages are as follows:

- Home
- About
- Map
- Restaurants
- Register (If the user is not logged in)
- Login (If the user is not logged in)
- Logout Button (If the user is logged in)

### Home

The main page is the home page. The home page initially displays a few top highly-rated restaurants. The user additionally has the choice to select the university they want to explore for nearby restaurants, along with specifying the rating of the restaurants they wish to view. The restaurants that meet the requirements are displayed when the user clicks on the submit form button.

These restaurants are obtained from the database, which contains the restaurants that were obtained from the Google API and the ones that were added by the admin. The addition of restaurants by the admin would be explained further in this README. The user can filter the restaurants that are being displayed by searching by the restaurant name. The other parts of the website just give additional information on what the user can do with the app, such as leaving a review, finding a restaurant near them, and requesting the addition of a new restaurant.

### About

This page gives a brief overview of what the website is about. It also shows the people who developed the website, namely, Joseph, Guilherme, and Sirak, alongside their respective email accounts. This will allow the user to contact any of the developers if they experience a problem with the website or want to add their restaurant to the website. There is also a button named "View Restaurants" which users can use to go to the "Restaurants" page directly.

### Map

This page shows a map that was created with leaflet. The default base map is Open Street Map. The user can use the layer control icon on the top right to change the base map to Satellite Map, Google Street Map, or Hybrid (which combines the satellite map and the Google street map). The user can utilize the dropdown button located below the layer control to determine which university they wish to observe regarding restaurants around the school they intend to locate.

When the user selects a university from the drop-down list, the map is zoomed to that particular university, and the university can be seen with a green marker while the restaurants near the university are displayed with a green marker. The location of the user is displayed with a blue circle. Additionally, the user can click on a restaurant icon to display the name of the restaurant. This is to give the user an idea of the...

### Restaurants

This page lets users see all the restaurants in our database without any limits. Users can explore freely without needing to set any rules or conditions. It's like opening a door to a world of different places to eat.

### Register

This button is used for registering new users on the platform. Users must provide their name, username, email, and password to register. An email is automatically sent to the user after they register to welcome them to the platform.

### Login

A user who has already been registered on the platform can log in with his username and password.

### Logout

A user who is logged in can log out of the website using the logout button.

### Website Functionality

- **Filtering:** The user gets to filter the restaurants by their name, the university they are located at, or the ratings of the restaurants. More filters will be added in the second release of the website.

- **Navigation:** Upon selecting a restaurant of interest, users are redirected to another page featuring a map interface. On this page, a routing path is displayed, guiding users from their current location to the selected restaurant. This interactive map enhances user experience by providing clear directions to the desired destination.

- **Commenting:** Users can comment on the restaurant they have been to. They can also update the comments they have posted about the restaurant. Additionally, they can delete the comment they have posted. This gives the restaurants a Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality.

## How the website runs

### Django Model

This project leverages Django, a high-level Python web framework, in conjunction with PostgreSQL

### Docker Containers

The Django application itself was served on the top of Docker containers, which enable the architecture to be designed in microservices. Therefore we got 2 containers (services): The Django app and the PostgreSQL database.

### Azure Virtual Machine

To host the application in the World Wide Web, the authors made use of a Azure Virtual Machine (VM), which functions as a Server for us in this project. The specific configuration of the Server as set through a terraform file (IaC).
